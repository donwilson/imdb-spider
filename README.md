# imdb-spider
Old PHP IMDb spider scripts used in 2013. Don't expect any of these scripts to work, merely just a demonstration of what's involved with spidering websites.

Requires a version of [pda/pheanstalk](https://github.com/pda/pheanstalk) from 2013 placed into `/pheanstalk`. Not sure which one, whoops.
